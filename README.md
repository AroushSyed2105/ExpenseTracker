# Expense Tracker Application
A simple JavaFX application that helps users track their monthly expenses. Users can add, edit, and delete expenses and see a running subtotal. The app also allows users to set a monthly budget, providing a warning if the budget limit is exceeded.

## Features
### Set Monthly Budget:

Upon launching the application, users are prompted to enter a monthly budget.
Once set, the main page will display the expense tracker and update the budget status as expenses are added.
#### Add Expense:

Users can add expenses by filling in the fields for Category, Amount, Date, and Description.
After adding, the input fields are automatically cleared for the next entry.
#### Edit Expense:

Select an existing expense from the table and update the fields with new values.
Click "Edit Expense" to apply the changes.
#### Delete Expense:

Select an existing expense from the table and click "Remove Expense" to delete it from the tracker.
#### Get Subtotal:

Displays the current total of all expenses.
#### Budget Monitoring:

The app checks the cumulative expense total against the monthly budget and displays a warning message if the budget is exceeded.
A label at the bottom of the main page shows the remaining budget or an over-budget warning.
